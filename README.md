# AML - Project: Feather in Focus!

### Goal

The goal of the challenge is to classify the bird image and find the name of the bird! This dataset contains 200 bird species, and the goal is to achieve a high accuracy in predicting the birds!

### Data

The dataset contains bird images, divided into train and test splits. The images are inside test_images and train_images folders.

The labels of the training images are inside train_images.csv file. In this file, the first column is image_path and the second one is the label (1 - 200). The test_images_samples.csv includes a row id with a dummy label. The final goal of the challenge is to change the label column to the predicted label.

The class_names.npy is a dictionary including the name of each label. Load the file using the following code:

```python
np.load("class_names.npy", allow_pickle=True).item()
```

The structure of the final submission should be exactly the same as the test_images_samples.csv! Otherwise, it will fail.

### Files:

- train_images - the training images
- test_images - the test images
- test_images_sample.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- test_images_path.csv - path to test file images
- train_images.csv - supplemental information about the data
- class_names.npy - this file includes the name of each label
- attributes.npy - this file includes the attributes which are extra information for each class.
